Bullfight,"Few local restaurants are as sexy as Shawn Cirkiel’s Bullfight. Maybe it’s the lighting, or the almost encyclopedic selection of sherries (nerds are sexy too), or the indoor-outdoor space. But we always have our rom-com moment when we bite into tapas like branzino crudo or veal sweetbreads a la plancha. We don’t even need a date.",4807 Airport,Austin,Texas,,,,http://www.bullfight-austin.com,http://www.austinchronicle.com/locations/bullfight-1669856/,http://www.austinchronicle.com/food/first-plates/2016/bullfight/,Midtown,512/474-2029
Barlata Tapas Bar,"Bringing authentic Spanish tapas by way of San Francisco, husband-and-wife team Daniel Olivella and Vanessa Jerez should be kissed for bringing this gem to South Lamar. What more could a person want than to be able to pick an assortment of small plates bursting with flavor, from squid ink paellas to traditional latas? Oh yes, to wash it all down with house-made sangria. Barlata’s got it all.",1500 S.

Barley Swine,"We were sad to see the intimate space on South Lamar close, but it didn’t take us long to warm up to the kitchen views, cozy tables, and full bar of the new location. The menu keeps on evolving too, as happens when you have one of the best kitchen teams in all of Austin.",6555 Burnet Rd. #400,Austin,Texas,,,,http://www.barleyswine.com,http://www.austinchronicle.com/locations/barley-swine-1142558/,http://www.austinchronicle.com/food/first-plates/2016/barley-swine/,Midtown,512/394-8150
Fukumoto,"Chef and owner Kazu Fukumoto embarked on an ambitious undertaking by incorporating an izakaya concept (which he defines as a “Japanese gastropub”) with yakitori (binchotan grilled skewers) and Edomae sushi that showcases top-notch fish. The chic saké-centric hangout is a go-to for unconventional eats like house-made tofu, firefly squid, and even grilled chicken butts.",514 Medina,Austin,Texas,,,,http://www.fukumotoaustin.com,http://www.austinchronicle.com/locations/fukumoto-1686735/,http://www.austinchronicle.com/food/first-plates/2016/fukumoto/,LowerEast,512/770-6880
La Cocina de Consuelo,"Starting with a church fundraiser that turned into a famed catering business, the owner/namesake of “Connie’s Kitchen” made her dream come true at 63 with the family-operated Mexican restaurant.

Nasha,"Specializing in Indian soul food, this psychedelic Eastside spot blends traditional dishes like tikka masala and saag paneer with Texas’ culinary traditions.

Juniper,"Executive chef and partner Nicholas Yanes’ handsome Northern Italian eatery may be new, but it has already made its mark in the Eastside’s budding fine-dining scene. The kitchen team prepares delicate pasta dishes and innovative small plates that nod to Texas, like risotto with local strawberry, avocado, and mint.

Royal Jelly,"The still-new, but ever-changing menu at Royal Jelly has us rushing back to try everything before the season dictates its expiration. Merguez lamb sliders with fennel-carrot-mint slaw and goat cheese is our current obsession. The all-Texas beer list ranges from sours to stouts, and the full bar makes a mean Mol’e Fashioned. It’s our favorite neighborhood bar – even if we have to travel from several neighborhoods over to enjoy it.",704 W.

VOX Table,"The seasonally changing yet always-gorgeous platings (read: highly ’grammable) have us coming back to VOX on the reg. Chef Joe Anguiano’s albacore tuna tartare scooped with a delicate potato lavash is divine, and smoked Tasmanian trout at brunch had us swimming.

Foreign & Domestic,"Housed in a converted gas station, Foreign & Domestic offers a refreshing mix of American classics and more exotic European fare. Although the restaurant’s odd cuts of meat is a conversation piece (tongues of assorted animals often guest-star on its ever-changing menu), it’s the chef’s attention to detail that keeps customers coming back for more.",306 E. 53rd,Austin,Texas,,,,http://www.fndaustin.com,http://www.austinchronicle.com/locations/foreign-and-domestic-1060330/,http://www.austinchronicle.com/food/first-plates/2016/foreign-and-domestic/,Midtown,512/459-1010
Arlo's,"Curbing carnivorous cravings has never been so easy. When even the most devout meat-eater yearns for the Bac’n Cheeze Burger from Arlo’s, you know the kitchen’s doing something right. This fleet now satisfies appetites all across town with its three trucks, but we personally pine for the Chik’n Tacos and tots washed down with a Gin Henry at Drinks Lounge.",2001 E.

Uchiko,"Translated as “child of uchi,” Tyson Cole’s sequel to his now-multiplying Uchi restaurant has grown into an identity of its own. With a killer happy hour, exquisite Japanese farmhouse cuisine, and a kitchen that produces some of Austin’s most talented chefs, it’s no wonder Uchiko has been packed nonstop since its 2010 opening.",4200 N.

Juliet Ristorante,"We can’t wait for drier weather so we can fold Juliet’s gorgeous patio into our happy hour rotation.

Bufalina,"A custom-built 900-degree pizza oven takes up a sizable portion of Bufalina’s dining room, but they pack the rest of the space elbow-to-elbow with Austinites hungry for the most delicate Neapolitan crust in the city. The scope ranges from subtle sure shots like their must-order margherita to more ambitious options like braised goat with Catalan chèvre. Need more space and shorter waits?

Komé,"As one of Austin’s first food trailer-gone-brick and mortar success stories, Komé has grown from its Sushi-A-Go-Go roots to serve as an anchor in Airport Boulevard’s booming restaurant scene. The izakaya-style restaurant run by Takehiro and Kayo Asazu is still a cozy neighborhood shop featuring homestyle Japanese cooking and some of the most affordable, quality sushi you can find in the city.",4917 Airport,Austin,Texas,,,,http://www.kome-austin.com,http://www.austinchronicle.com/locations/kome-1326020/,http://www.austinchronicle.com/food/first-plates/2016/kome/,Midtown,512/712-5700
Chi'Lantro BBQ,"Let’s be honest; you’re here for the kimchi fries. And they are amazing, especially topped with the spicy pork. With a fifth location on the way, Chi’Lantro is becoming something of a local empire; you might as well get in on the action before they go national.",1509 S.

Buenos Aires Café Este,"Chef Reina Morris brought her native Argentinian cuisine to Austin over a decade ago, and her restaurants have been a mainstay ever since.

Uchi,"Rumor has it that Matthew McConaughey frequents this classy sushi joint and orders nothing but sea bream sashimi. We would be fine with just that as well – no soy sauce or wasabi needed on the immaculate cuts of fresh fish – but other menu items (Wagyu hot rock, tiger shrimp tempura, or the hakujin roll, to name a few) make it nearly impossible to not go all-out.",801 S.

Noble Sandwich Co.,"Ludwig Mies van der Rohe was fond of saying “less is more,” but that’s probably because he never had a Noble sandwich. Take the seared beef tongue piled with smoked green onions, red pepper relish, and tangy aïoli. Who needs minimalism when maximalism is so delicious?",4805 Burnet Rd.,Austin,Texas,,,,http://www.noblesandwiches.com,http://www.austinchronicle.com/locations/noble-sandwich-co-1527726/,http://www.austinchronicle.com/food/first-plates/2016/noble-sandwich-co/,Midtown,512/666-5124
Jacoby's Restaurant & Mercantile,"Want to impress your parents the first time they visit you in Austin? Take them to Jacoby’s.

Cantine,"If restaurants were greatest hits albums, Cantine would be burning up the charts. Hospitality veterans Lisa and Emmett Fox borrowed elements from their Hyde Park classic, Asti, and sorely missed Hollywood Regency stunner Fino for their new venture in the Lamar Union development. The result is an innovative Mediterranean restaurant with a bright dining room and a serious beverage program that couldn’t be more contemporary.",1100 S.

Odd Duck,"Any person walking into Odd Duck for the first time will see the open kitchen and wood-fired oven and know they’re about to get both dinner and a show. Starting as a trailer by Barley Swine owner Bryce Gilmore, Odd Duck focuses on letting local ingredients speak for themselves through small plates, like the duck fat fried rice and sweet potato with green chile. Some dishes are so good, you’ll find yourself ordering another round of them before the night is over.",1201 S.

Justine's Brasserie,"This “Best of Austin” and “First Plates” veteran continues to be our own private party. No matter how many times we traipse to Justine’s, every visit is a brand-new experience – thanks to nightly blackboard specials like flounder with spring onions, or bison- and bacon-stuffed cabbage. Mainstays like the steak frites and superlative pork chops will never cease to please. It’s like a long-lasting relationship: familiar and intimate, but simultaneously exciting. We’re still in love.",4710 E.

Sazón,"This South Austin favorite visits different culinary regions of Mexico, with nuanced twists and an emphasis on a worldwide food staple – corn – with delectable crema de elote and handmade corn tortillas. Enchiladas de mole, or de pipián, are solid choices, and the garlic rice is a nice detour from oft-featured Spanish rice.",1816 S.

The Hightower,"The outside might look a little like an Eastside dive bar, but the Hightower isn’t about pouring Jameson shots to denim vest-wearing beardos. Yes, there is a full bar, but the focus is chef Chad Dolezal’s quietly adventurous menu that blends the Lone Star State’s culinary traditions with a global palate. We’ll drink to that.",1209 E.

Épicerie,"Perfect for a casual Sunday brunch, this neighborhood French-American restaurant makes you feel just a little bit fancy and right at home all at once. The airy cafe and grocery shop offers simple but well-executed dishes like cured salmon toast, gnocchi, and a burger with a side of frites. If you’re only feeling peckish, get a custom cheese plate and a bottle of rosé, and call it un jour.",2307 Hancock,Austin,Texas,,,,http://www.epicerieaustin.com,http://www.austinchronicle.com/locations/epicerie-cafe-and-grocery-1434358/,http://www.austinchronicle.com/food/first-plates/2016/epicerie-cafe-and-grocery/,Midtown,512/371-6840
Daito,"This humble mom and pop's shop highlights exquisite handmade udon that's difficult to find outside Japan. Their meticulously prepared dashi broth brings deep umami to comfort staples like chawanmushi. The manager Yoshi, currently pursuing saké sommelier licensure in Japan, enjoys introducing diners to lesser-known premium varieties.",2716 1/2 Guadalupe St.,Austin,Texas,,,,http://www.restaurantdaito.com/,http://www.austinchronicle.com/locations/daito-1672902/,http://www.austinchronicle.com/food/first-plates/2016/daito/,Campus,512/474-7770
Stiles Switch BBQ & Brew,"You know that feeling you have every time Garth Brooks’ “Friends in Low Places” comes on?

Sala & Betty,"The vision behind this neighborhood spot was to provide wholesome food quickly, and it does just that. Run by former Aquarelle owner, Teresa Wilson, Sala & Betty can still teach Austin’s food scene a thing or two on inventive ways to use vegetables, like its cauliflower tortillas and mushroom “meatloaf,” to name a few. What’s more, you can get your meal to-go via the drive-through.",5201 Airport,Austin,Texas,,,,http://www.salaandbettyatx.com,http://www.austinchronicle.com/locations/sala-and-betty-1611116/,http://www.austinchronicle.com/food/first-plates/2016/sala-and-betty/,Midtown,512/645-0214
Launderette,"Chronicle readers endowed Launderette with Best New Restaurant honors last year in the annual “Best of Austin” poll, and we are perpetually wowed. Sweet lump crab toast, whole branzino, and burrata with black mission figs all induce audible sighs of bliss, but we’re most impressed by chef Rene Ortiz’s treatment of vegetables – his transformation of humble cauliflower using pickled pear, fresno chiles, and mustard vinaigrette is otherworldly. Laura Sawicki’s desserts are equally a special treat.",2115 Holly,Austin,Texas,,,,http://www.launderetteaustin.com,http://www.austinchronicle.com/locations/launderette-1611113/,http://www.austinchronicle.com/food/first-plates/2016/launderette/,LowerEast,512/382-1599
Paperboy,"The humble, gravel-lot breakfast trailer sells out before many Austin slackers have left the house, but their brioche B.E.C. and steak & egg sandwiches are worth setting an alarm for. If the sandwiches are 86’d, the requisite 2016-style toasts (savory with goat chorizo or sweet with ricotta and tangerine marmalade) are equally eye-opening.",1203 E. 11th,Austin,Texas,,,,http://www.paperboyaustin.com,http://www.austinchronicle.com/locations/paperboy-1836259/,http://www.austinchronicle.com/food/first-plates/2016/paperboy/,LowerEast,
Taco Joint,"There are few breakfast taco secrets left in Austin, but this campus-area hangover cure has been left largely untouched except for a steady stream of UT students and staff.

Don Japanese Food Truck,"Every day, hordes of UT students line up for Don Japanese's pork belly or Veggie King bowls. Why? Because you are not likely to find a more harmonious marriage of price, quality, and taste (so what, it's a triad) in all of Austin. A brief hiatus has us patiently waiting for May 12.",28th & Guadalupe,Austin,Texas,,,,http://www.fb.com/don-japanese-food-truck-692738280861004,http://www.austinchronicle.com/locations/don-japanese-food-truck-1826678/,http://www.austinchronicle.com/food/first-plates/2016/don-japanese-food-truck/,Campus,512/725-3686
Toaster,"The description of the baked mac on the menu says it all: “It’s fucking delightful.” From the avocado crema-topped Scotch eggs at brunch to classic cheese-and-potato pierogies at dinner, Toaster is all about hitting your pleasure centers – proving that in these tweezered and bespoke culinary times, food is still about how it makes you feel.",1910 E.

Via 313,"Forever famous for their Detroit-style square pan pies with a caramelized cheese crust, the newest locations (both full-service restaurants with a full menu) offer apps like stuffed artichokes, beet salads with candied prosciutto, and thin-crust ""bar style"" pizzas that are – gasp! – round.

la Barbecue,"Much has been written about pitmaster John Lewis’ way with brisket and ribs, and we won’t deny the power in the smoke. But we will take a moment to herald genius sandwiches like La Frito Loco. It may start with pulled pork, but it adds chopped beef, corn chips, black bean salad, chipotle slaw, cheese, and jalapeños.

Goodall's Kitchen,"Nestled in the lobby of the historic Hotel Ella, Goodall's Kitchen is a welcome refuge from the ubiquitous spread of pizza joints and taco shops of West Campus.

Asiana Indian Cuisine,"In present-day Austin, we often forget that good isn’t a synonym for unaffordable. Asiana’s lunch buffet doesn’t require a late credit card payment, but it’s stocked with saag paneer, and lamb vindaloo, and rotating specials – in short, a showpiece for everything the bare-bones restaurant has to offer.

Salt & Time Butcher Shop & Salumeria,"Artisanal butchering may have been supplanted by other food trends nationally, but the movement hasn’t slowed down in Texas. Salt & Time still excel at the nose-to-tail tradition, evidenced by their in-house charcuterie and rotating offal specials.

Fork & Vine,"When we think of neighborhood restaurants, we usually think of dives.

Texas French Bread,"One of the most pleasant things about Texas French Bread has nothing to do with the food.

Din Ho Chinese BBQ,"You know your restaurant offers something special when Austinites are willing to brave the journey from south to north just for a taste of the roast duck.

Olamaie,"We are not saying that the phrase ""Jesus is a biscuit"" has anything to do with Olamaie, but if any one biscuit is worthy of such religious thoughts, it's the one made by chefs Michael Fojtasek and Grae Nonas.

Kin & Comfort,"The digs aren’t fancy (it’s a grocery store food court after all), but chef Ek Timrerk’s confident blend of Thai and Southern cuisines defies location.

Veracruz All Natural,"In the preliminary round of the Chronicle’s breakfast taco competition, Veracruz beat out Torchy’s 60% to 40% – no easy feat.

Independence Fine Foods,"The beef cheeks are braised for hours, the pork belly is cured in-house, and the brioche are baked on-site.

Titaya's Thai Cuisine,"A collective cry was let out when Austin’s mainstay Titaya’s closed for extensive renovations a few years back.

Thai-Kun,"If you can’t stand the heat, get out of this kitchen.

Saffron,"Austin’s first dedicated Nepalese menu lives in a West Austin strip mall.

Home Slice Pizza,"This beloved hang spot might have the best mascot in town: a queen of pies with rockin’ ’stache and a sly wink.

Fixe,"Louisiana native chef James Robert plates up elevated, playful Southern eats. The team executes a fine balance between classics-done-well (like their famed biscuits) and outside-the-box concepts (like lobster & crawfish pot pie).

Evangeline Cafe,"All the Cajun classics are here – gumbo, jambalaya, étouffée, red beans and rice – but owner/chef Curtis Clarke’s less traditional creations like Gold Band Creole (huge fried butterflied shrimp served on fettuccine with a spicy aïoli and a titular strip of Parmesan) steal the show.

Tâm Deli & Cafe,"Folks in the know talk about Tâm’s bánh mì with whispered reverence. It’s easy to see why.

Otoko,"Like Buccellati engagement rings or the Olsen twins, good things come in small packages.

Wu Chow,"Like Edie Sedgwick or Karlie Kloss, Wu Chow's Shanghai soup dumplings have been the muse for all sorts of artistic endeavors.

Valentina's Tex Mex BBQ,"In Texas, eschewing barbecue traditions is risky, but Valentina’s pulls off the rare feat of marrying tortillas and smoked meats with such finesse that even the grouchiest salt-and-pepper stalwarts could be convinced that fusion isn’t a dirty word.

Unit-D Pizzeria,"The craveworthy menu offers Neapolitan pizza topped with fresh ingredients ranging from classic to creative, but it isn't just about pizza at Unit-D.

Proof & Cooper,"With simple fare like deviled eggs and fried pickles, Proof & Cooper doesn’t seem like it belongs on any “best of” lists.

Hopdoddy Burger Bar,"It’s hard to resist the sirens’ call of a big juicy handcrafted burger, especially from a place that offers endless variations in toppings and proteins. Even though this Austin original opens its fourth location soon, it still packs the house – proving that craft burgers are more than just a trend.",1400 S.

Café No Sé,"You could easily play hipster food bingo with Café No Sé’s menu (Avocado toast? Check! Kale salad? Yup!) but the execution here is flawless, simultaneously excessive and elegant. #foodporn-worthy bites for the Instagirl in your life that taste good enough that you don’t mind putting up with her.",1603 S.

Threadgill's North,Calling Eddie Wilson’s down-home restaurant an institution is an understatement. Generations of Austinites have downed a beer (or two) at Threadgill’s while feasting on chicken-fried steaks that are as legendary as the musicians who performed there. The massive selection of sides still makes us hoot and holler.,6416 N.

Oasthouse Kitchen + Bar,"This new favorite from District Kitchen + Cocktails chef/partner Amir Hajimaleki’s adventurous cuisine blends global influences like German (veal schnitzel), Caribbean (jerk pork tenderloin), and Irish (shepherd’s pie) foods without ever feeling disjointed. We love that he’s bringing the gospel of good food to the outskirts of Austin.",8300 FM 620 N.,Austin,Texas,,,,http://www.oasthouseaustin.com,http://www.austinchronicle.com/locations/oasthouse-kitchen-bar-1690988/,http://www.austinchronicle.com/food/first-plates/2016/oasthouse-kitchen-bar/,West,737/222-5779
Lenoir,"A rare affordable date spot in a crowded high-dollar dining scene, Lenoir’s three-course prix fixe remains the best value and one of the most dazzling meals in town, with dishes like masa-stuffed quail and cold crawfish salad defying categorization without confusing taste buds.",1807 S. First,Austin,Texas,,,,http://www.lenoirrestaurant.com,http://www.austinchronicle.com/locations/lenoir-1321295/,http://www.austinchronicle.com/food/first-plates/2016/lenoir/,SouthCongressandSouthFirst,512/215-9778
Contigo,"Boasting one of Austin's best outdoor spaces – modeled after its namesake ranch – and a creative assortment of Texas tapas, this is a pitch-perfect happy hour spot. It fills up fast with the neighborhood crowd, but you can sip an El Pepino, crunch popcorn and olive bar snacks, and throw horseshoes while you wait.",2027 Anchor,Austin,Texas,,,,http://www.contigotexas.com/austin,http://www.austinchronicle.com/locations/contigo-1230020/,http://www.austinchronicle.com/food/first-plates/2016/contigo/,East,512/614-2260
Visconti Ristorante,"A lot of new Italian restaurants have opened in the last year or so, but few can actually transport you to Italy. Housed in the luxurious Hotel Granduca, Visconti is a mini-vacation with the type of attentive service that is rare in America. Executive chef Tom Parlo’s cuisine completes the illusion with thoughtful Northern Italian specialties.",320 Capital of TX Hwy.

Olive & June,"Austin’s no longer lacking Italian options, but before last year’s flood of tagliatelle, Olive & June built a rep as a reliably great place to enjoy classics like cacio e pepe as well as creative interpretations like saffron-ricotta ravioli. There’s just enough upscale decor to make a plate of spaghetti feel elegant, with a wine cellar to match.",3411 Glenview,Austin,Texas,,,,http://www.oliveandjune-austin.com,http://www.austinchronicle.com/locations/olive-and-june-1326191/,http://www.austinchronicle.com/food/first-plates/2016/olive-and-june/,West,512/467-9898
Jenna's Asian Kitchen,"Besides the relatively affordable cost of living, there’s another reason to move out to Cedar Park. Jenna’s namesake chef Jenna Choe can make something as workaday as crab rangoon into a tour de force, and her fresh takes on Korean classics like bibimbap give suburbanites something to throw back in the faces of their snobby urban neighbors.",12300 RR 620 N.,Austin,Texas,,,,http://www.jennasasiankitchen.com/,http://www.austinchronicle.com/locations/jennas-asian-kitchen-1659334/,http://www.austinchronicle.com/food/first-plates/2016/jennas-asian-kitchen/,West,512/258-8282
Fonda San Miguel,"Serving regional Mexican cuisine since 1975, Fonda San Miguel is as much of an Austin icon as it is a great happy hour spot. The walls of the expansive hacienda-style space showcase a fine gallery of Mexican art, and the dishes served are equally remarkable.

Pieous,"You can bet that any restaurant with bacon marmalade pizza, soft pillowy crusts on Neapolitan-style pies, and a penchant for pastrami will have a dedicated following willing to make the Dripping Springs drive. Add in giant chocolate chip cookies and draft beer, and it’s practically a religion.",12005 Hwy. 290 W.,Austin,Texas,,,,http://www.fb.com/pieous,http://www.austinchronicle.com/locations/pieous-1461715/,http://www.austinchronicle.com/food/first-plates/2016/pieous/,West,512/394-7041
Cafe Josie,"For most restaurants, all-you-can-eat is a concept meant to pack in the masses. For Cafe Josie chef Todd Havers, it’s an antidote to upscale dining that still leaves you hungry after a hefty bill. “The experience,” the name for the recently launched unlimited prix fixe, is proof that this Clarksville fixture can still teach this town some new tricks.",1200-B W.

Jobell Cafe and Bistro,"Owners David and Jessenia Bober took a risk when they left New York to open a restaurant on a winding Hill Country road, but the cuisine – saké-cured gravlax, lamb and pork pappardelle, steak frites – couldn’t be more assured. With one of the most cozy dining rooms in the area, it is the definition of destination dining.",16920 RR 12,Wimberley,Texas,,,,http://www.jobellcafe.com,http://www.austinchronicle.com/locations/jobell-cafe-and-bistro-1842678/,http://www.austinchronicle.com/food/first-plates/2016/jobell-cafe-and-bistro/,West,
Patrizi's,"Embodying the idea that simplicity is a marker of sophistication, the made-to-order fresh pasta is one of our favorites in town. Open for dinner, the unassuming food truck in the Butterfly Bar courtyard boasts house-made ricotta, local veggies and eggs, and dishes designed around time-honored family flavors. The Pomodoro's roasted romas and garlic confit is worth a weekly trip.",2307 Manor Rd.,Austin,Texas,,,,http://www.patrizis.com,http://www.austinchronicle.com/locations/patrizis-1476419/,http://www.austinchronicle.com/food/first-plates/2016/patrizis/,East,512/522-4834
