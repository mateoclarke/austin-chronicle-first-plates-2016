Cafe Josie,"For most restaurants, all-you-can-eat is a concept meant to pack in the masses. For Cafe Josie chef Todd Havers, it’s an antidote to upscale dining that still leaves you hungry after a hefty bill. “The experience,” the name for the recently launched unlimited prix fixe, is proof that this Clarksville fixture can still teach this town some new tricks.",1200-B W.

Patrizi's,"Embodying the idea that simplicity is a marker of sophistication, the made-to-order fresh pasta is one of our favorites in town. Open for dinner, the unassuming food truck in the Butterfly Bar courtyard boasts house-made ricotta, local veggies and eggs, and dishes designed around time-honored family flavors. The Pomodoro's roasted romas and garlic confit is worth a weekly trip.",2307 Manor Rd.,Austin,Texas,http://www.patrizis.com,http://www.austinchronicle.com/locations/patrizis-1476419/,http://www.austinchronicle.com/food/first-plates/2016/patrizis/,East,512/522-4834
Proof & Cooper,"With simple fare like deviled eggs and fried pickles, Proof & Cooper doesn’t seem like it belongs on any “best of” lists. But those deviled eggs pop with smoked paprika, and the fried pickles are made from in-house bread-and-butters. Heck, even the ranch dressing is a work of art. There’s no pretention here, just perfectly crafted comfort food and cocktails.",18710 Hamilton Pool Rd.,Dripping Springs,Texas,http://www.proofandcooper.com,http://www.austinchronicle.com/locations/proof-and-cooper-1819471/,http://www.austinchronicle.com/food/first-plates/2016/proof-and-cooper/,West,
Greenhouse Craft Food,"Who says that the ’burbs can’t have good food? Chef Rob Snow’s eclectic cafe brings the foodie gospel up north with serious sandwiches and burgers, locally sourced salads, and one of the best macaroni & cheeses in all of Central Texas. Don’t forget to check out the specials, ranging from grilled shrimp in strawberry cocktail sauce to goat bolognese.",1400 E.

Jack Allen's Kitchen Round Rock,"Chef Jack Gilmore’s locally sourced menu is about as Texan as it gets: hearty portions of comfort food jam-packed with big flavor, served in a sophisticated boots-and-starched-denim setting. Tacos, buns, grillin’s, and chicken-fried anything makes up the bulk of the menu, with surf, turf, and daily specials giving something for everyone in the family.",2500 Hoppe Trail,Round Rock,Texas,http://www.austinchronicle.com/locations/jack-allens-kitchen-round-rock-1346831/,,http://www.austinchronicle.com/food/first-plates/2016/jack-allens-kitchen-round-rock/,NorthandNorthwest,
Apis Restaurant & Apiary,"This fine-dining hive nestled on the Pedernales is even better than its buzz. Chef Taylor Hall’s dedication to seasonal and local fare, plus the on-site apiary and new covered patio, make this an unforgettable dinner. Try the honeycomb-infused Texas bourbon craft cocktail and the buttermilk biscuits with honey butter.",23526 Hwy. 71 W.,Spicewood,Texas,http://www.apisrestaurant.com,http://www.austinchronicle.com/locations/apis-restaurant-and-apiary-1591554/,http://www.austinchronicle.com/food/first-plates/2016/apis-restaurant-and-apiary/,West,
Jobell Cafe and Bistro,"Owners David and Jessenia Bober took a risk when they left New York to open a restaurant on a winding Hill Country road, but the cuisine – saké-cured gravlax, lamb and pork pappardelle, steak frites – couldn’t be more assured. With one of the most cozy dining rooms in the area, it is the definition of destination dining.",16920 RR 12,Wimberley,Texas,http://www.jobellcafe.com,http://www.austinchronicle.com/locations/jobell-cafe-and-bistro-1842678/,http://www.austinchronicle.com/food/first-plates/2016/jobell-cafe-and-bistro/,West,
